#####  :round_pushpin: An app by and for denizens of their respective cities to find cool or off-the-radar spots/activites!

### What? 
- The idea for the name comes from games, wherein a player has finished an area of a map or the whole map.
What do they do now?  Well find all those small collectibles & Easter Eggs!  This tries to catalogue that a bit for locals.

### Why?
I feel like there‚Äôs a ton of boring blog travel guides articles for every city imaginable.  
They overlook many things that are more
- niche, 
- off the radar, 
- new, (fun?)
Or anything that can fit synonymously with those.  This is where the app fills a gap! It is a full stack web application, utilizing Leafletjs to display user created pins displayed to an open source map for all! Tag cool locations while you're out, or mark ones you know and share with friends.

It's still under development in the early phases, but initial release is planned soon!
