                üìç An app by and for denizens of their respective cities to find cool or off-the-radar spots/activites!
                <h3 class="text-bold">What?</h3><br>
                The idea for the name comes from games, wherein a player has finished an area of a map or the whole map. What do they do now? Well find all those small collectibles & Easter Eggs! This tries to catalogue that a bit for locals.
                <h3 class="text-bold">Why?</h3><br>
                I feel like there‚Äôs a ton of boring blog travel guides articles for every city imaginable.
                They overlook many things that are more
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-item">niche</li>
                    <li class="list-item">off the radar</li>
                    <li class="list-item">new (fun?)</li>
                    <li class="list-item">Or anything that can fit synonymously with those</li>
                </ul><br>
                This is where the app fills a gap! Tag cool locations while you're out, or mark ones you know and share with friends.
